### On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous

*Read first in the midst of the pandemic, then again in November 2023*

*"I am thinking of beauty again, how some things are hunted because we have deemed them beautiful. If, relative to the history of our planet, an individual life is so short, a blink, as they say, then to be gorgeous, even from the day you're born to the day you die, is to be gorgeous only briefly."* ― **Ocean Vuong**

I picked this book up in all sincerity because I was longing for some gay fiction, with hope that a little smut will sneak in, and boy did I get some of that. What I've not expected from this experience, was a heart-wrenching story that made me think, and cry, and it enveloped me with emotions I've never felt with this masterpiece. My eyes scanned through the words, to only go a few sentences back, adjusting myself to sit upright, and carefully read the lines, looking around, zoning out, reminding myself this is not real life. Loving someone can be so painful, when we are on divergent paths. Losing them forever, is a stab in the heart. 

*I miss you more than I remember you.* ― **Ocean Vuong**

### America is Not the Heart

*Read in November 2023*

*“You already know that the first thing that makes you foreign to a place is to be born poor in it; you don't need to emigrate to America to feel what you already felt when you were ten, looking up at the rickety concrete roof above your head and knowing that one more bad typhoon would bring it down to crush your bones and the bones of all your siblings sleeping next to you; or selling fruit by the side of the road to people who made sure to never really look at you, made sure not to touch your hands when they put the money in it. You've been foreign all your life. When you finally leave, all you're hoping for is a more bearable kind of foreignness.”* ― **Elaine Castillo**

My home to me, today at least, is as foreign as it can get. Here, without my family nor loved ones, but despite the distance, feels more like 'home'. A story about leaving behind the world you knew, one that spat on your face, and turning around to another that you don't belong, but finding warmth and familiarty in it. I'd like to tell that story. And of course, mine wasn't fraught with violence, abandonment, and unrelentless work, but the book resonated with me in inexplicable ways. It reminded me of mum. It reminded me of the journey, of immigration, the idealization of home, to find disappointing apparitions of the past that haunt you till this day. Regardless, Castillo chose to close the story with pancit, a lot of it in fact, filling the mouths (and hearts) of the De Vera family in spite of the simmering tensions that characterize family life.
