### Data Engineer

*Farm Credit Services of America*

May 2022 - Aug 2022

The opportunity that I had to do an internship at FCSA is definitely one that changed the outlook of my life significantly. I don't know it then, but it would push me to do many things. It was a complicated summer, a very distressful one simply because I was stuck in a suburb in Omaha, NE with no reliable way of transporting myself anywhere. Thank God for Mauricio! I will forever be indebted to him for I would definitely go crazy if I was stuck there. 

But shame on me for not remembering the wonderful folks I worked with there. I had many interesting, contradicting feelings about the work. For one, it started off extremely confusing, not really knowing what the hell I was supposed to do, nor what was expected of me (hint: I was an intern, so probably just not breaking things). I felt so lost, especially thinking that I should have taken the math research route. Honestly, I am glad the way things turned out. I don't think I can do math research, those folks are way too smart! But I am glad that we had an interesting project towards the end, and I enjoyed it plenty!

### Software Developer
*Farm Credit Services of America*

August 2021 - May 2022

**Associate at the Raikes School of Computer Science and Management**

This was a senior year project that all Computer Science students have to be part of and thank god I was told to apply to this program! The alternative in the **actual** Computer Science department was a disaster, and nobody ended up learning anything from that experience. 

Luck defined that year, with a complete unexpected alignment of what I was doing in my own research, and the privilege to be in a fantastic team, both amongst ourselves (Kyle & Eric, and Sophia & Emily) and our Sponsor (Patrick). Working on technology that I had a lot of passion in (Neo4j's Graph Database), while learning and picking up ones that grind my gears (C#), it was a blast, and a tipping point for all the opportunities that came after. 

The project is featured in Design Studio's Annual Report 2021-2022.
