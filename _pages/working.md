### Software Developer
*Farm Credit Services of America*

August 2020 - May 2021

**Associate at the Raikes School of Computer Science and Management**

This was a senior year project that all Computer Science students have to be part of and thank god I was told to apply to this program! The alternative in the **actual** Computer Science department was a disaster, and nobody ended up learning anything from that experience. 

Luck defined that year, with a complete unexpected alignment of what I was doing in my own research, and the privilege to be in a fantastic team, both amongst ourselves (Kyle & Eric, and Sophia & Emily) and our Sponsor (Patrick). Working on technology that I had a lot of passion in (Neo4j's Graph Database), while learning and picking up ones that grind my gears (C#), it was a blast, and a tipping point for all the opportunities that came after.
