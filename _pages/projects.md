These are my side projects that I have done over time. Rather proud of them, and that is why they are on display, and I hope you enjoy them.

### Eviction in Nebraska

This project was initially started as a fun project back in UNL, exploring the great and interesting world of graph database and graph analysis. Unfortunately, a lot of that is now relegated to the side (the graph-side of things). The good thing is, I am currently working on a paper based on this analysis on the Bandwagon Effect in R&D for firms. Really excited about it and hopefully something will come out of it!

Imagine a vaccine that could distribute itself. No appointments, no shipping, no expiration dates. This vaccine would be be created by making a more infectious but less deadly variant of the disease. Then a Patient Zero would be infected and sent into the population to spread the vaccine. Unethical? Almost certainly. Interesting to study? Absolutely!

This is an exploration of a dataset of Airbnb listings in New York City from 2008 to 2021. Here we explored different Data Mining algorithms to identify patterns within the dataset with a strong geospatial emphasis.
