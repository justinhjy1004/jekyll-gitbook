Former Research Associate at Harvard, currently funemployed. Taking a break after all that has transpired in the land that I once thought would be the place I call home, after all my hopes and dreams have been crushed, and all the people and squoose I have to leave behind, so swiftly by a single man. Oh, I don't know what the future holds for me, I am both anxious and excited.

Though I know one thing for sure. Regardless of my situation, I am a committed life long learner. My time in Boston has opened up a world so fascinating and so interesting that all that has happened would not be enough to stop me from continuing my academic curiosity. It has been a difficult time, and what is ahead of me, I do reserve plenty of fear just for that, but I know through it all, I will be okay.
