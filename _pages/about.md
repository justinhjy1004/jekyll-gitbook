The obituary style picture is my profile picture in LinkedIn, and that could explain my lack of success in the job market overall. Currently, I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School.

I studied in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for my undergraduate degree, and aspiring to get a PhD sometime in the future. As to which PhD program, I do not know, and my interest lies sporadically and widely across Economics, Philosophy, Social Sciences, Linguistics in general, but also Mathematics and Computer Science.

Does that make me a polymath? No. Definitely not. An aspiring polymath maybe, but that is no longer a thing in the world that I currently live in. That is a whole separate rabbit hole that I don't want to go into this page. But that is me in a nutshell, not the most interesting person in the world, and I am learning how to be okay with that.
