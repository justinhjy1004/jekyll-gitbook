*"No se preocupe, ocupese"* - **la abuela de Mariano**

I intend to have this page as a "portfolio" of my professional life, but also to document my personal one, at least for things that I am ready to share. 

I hope to continue and maintain this website. I love learning, sharing, reading and exploring the world. Though this sounds like a LinkedIn post, they are nevertheless true. They don't define my entirety, nor do I know how to define myself, but I think it does cover quite a few bases.

That is me, with my sister and my mum in Seoul, a moment in time I wish stayed frozen. Fresh from the pain of leaving Nebraska, with the promise of Boston ahead of me, Seoul was my transit to the second act (for my twenties). That brief moment of change is weirdly what I longed for the most, and it was beautiful.
