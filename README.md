I intend to have this page as a way to showcase the things I have done in work, but also to document my life, at least for things that I care about to share. 

One of my goals is to continue and maintain this website. I love learning, sharing, reading and exploring the world, and sadly, this sounds like a LinkedIn post, but they are true. I am not sure if they define me per se, but I think it does cover quite a few bases.
