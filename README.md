<center><strong><em>Hat man sein Warum? des Lebens, so verträgt man sich fast mit jedem Wie? — Friedrich Nietzsche</em></strong></center>

I intend to have this page as a "portfolio" of my professional life, but also to document my personal one, at least for things that I am ready to share. 

I hope to continue and maintain this website. I love learning, sharing, reading and exploring the world. Though this sounds like a LinkedIn post, they are nevertheless true. They don't define my entirety, nor do I know how to define myself, but I think it does cover quite a few bases.

*Summer of 2025*

I am not sure how I will see the Summer of 2025. As it has ended, it was simultaneously filled with the joy of traveling with my family to both London, and Vienna, and soon after a tour around Malaysia and Thailand with my Neinei. A trip that I will never forget from the love that I have from all of them, and the separation that soon followed that left me bereft of a sense of purpose and direction.

I really miss you Neinei. You have been such an encompassing part of my last two years in Boston, and I know we will always be in touch, but things are no longer the same. We can only move on, and live our respective lives to the fullest in honour of the care we have for each other. The hardest part of leaving Boston is that I had to leave you too, and I am really sorry.

But I know you will come to achieve great things. And the time that I had with you will always be with me. 

*Summer of 2023*

That is me, with my sister and my mum in Seoul, a moment in time I wish stayed frozen. Fresh from the pain of leaving Nebraska, with the promise of Boston ahead of me, Seoul was my transit to the second act (for my twenties). That brief moment of change is weirdly what I longed for the most, and it was beautiful.
